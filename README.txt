In this program I had trouble reading the files into the vector. I also had trouble getting the widths to line up
correctly. figuring out how to implement each function for each class was difficult to start and it got
confusing working with all those files. It really help working with classes because I got a better understanding of
how they work. Everything is up and running the way it should now.
